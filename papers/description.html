You have two choices when it comes to formatting academic papers for conferences and journals: Microsoft Word and LaTeX.

Word is familiar and easy for anyone to pick up. But the WYSIWYG interface that makes it so easy also makes it easy to create inconsistent, amateur-looking documents that are tough to maintain and fine-tune. On top of this, you get a file format that isn’t friendly to revision control, diminishing collaboration through a system like GitHub.

LaTeX is powerful and produces beautiful documents, but requires installing a hefty toolchain, learning a new syntax, and familiarizing yourself with its powerful abstractions. This is a significant front-end investment, one that may not pay off. In my experience, there’s usually at least one author who hasn’t made that investment, and so the team falls back to Word anyway.

PubCSS is an exploration of HTML and CSS as a third option. It’s a library of stylesheets and templates for formatting academic papers. Perhaps HTML and CSS can hit the sweet spot between the ease of Word and the efficiency LaTeX. Like LaTeX, HTML is a markup language, but one that a lot more people have experience with. CSS has proven its worth for styling fluid layouts, and with CSS3 modules around the corner, things can only improve for print.
